# Git Commit EN

## Instructions

Create a commit message in English by combining:

- What was discussed in the current session.
- The staged diff preview from this exact command:
  - `git diff --staged | cut -c 1-2000`

## Workflow

1. Read the session context and identify intent (why the change exists).
2. Run `git diff --staged | cut -c 1-2000` and extract key change points.
3. Pick an appropriate Conventional Commits type (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, etc.).
4. Write the message in this format:

```text
type(scope): short summary

line 1 explaining why/impact
line 2 optional
line 3 optional
```

## Output Rules

- Follow Conventional Commits.
- Title must be a single concise line.
- Body must be at most 3 lines total.
- Keep the body focused on purpose/impact, not noisy implementation detail.
- If scope is unclear, omit scope rather than guessing.
